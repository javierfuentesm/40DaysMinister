# The Preaching of Simon, the Son of Cleopas
Jesus appears to the disciples as they cast lots on the Mount of Olives. Simon asks the Lord to be with them, and for Peter to accompany him to Samaria on his missionary journey (A, fol. 26b, col. 1). The Lord instructs Simon to return to Jerusalem after he finishes his preaching, where he will become the successor to James the Just’s bishopric, and end his life as James did (A, fol. 26b, col. 1).
