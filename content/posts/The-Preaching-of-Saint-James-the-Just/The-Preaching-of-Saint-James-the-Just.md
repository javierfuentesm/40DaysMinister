# The Preaching of Saint James the Just
The apostles cast lots to decide who should preach in which parts of the world, and James gets chosen to preach in Jerusalem (B, fol. 114a col. 1; A, fol. 29a, col. 2; B, fol. 114a, col. 2). Because he knows that the Jews will “seek to kill” him he pleads that he might be assigned to go amongst the gentiles. Jesus then assures James that he is needed in Jerusalem, and prophesies that he will become “Bishop in Jerusalem” and end his life nobly – by death (A, fol. 29b, col. 1).
