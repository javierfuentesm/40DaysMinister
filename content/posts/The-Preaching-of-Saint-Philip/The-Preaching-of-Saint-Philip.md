# The Preaching of Saint Philip and Saint Peter
While gathered on the Mount of Olives, Jesus appears to His disciples, asking why they have not yet begun to preach. They cast lots and give specific assignments to one another (A, fol. 55a, col. 2). Jesus appears again, this time to only Peter and Philip, and assures them of future glory so great that they “shall forget [their] sufferings” (B, fol. 161a col. 1). Jesus appears once more and encourages them to an attitude of greater urgency, promising them guidance and revelation as they toil (B, fol. 161b, col. 1).
