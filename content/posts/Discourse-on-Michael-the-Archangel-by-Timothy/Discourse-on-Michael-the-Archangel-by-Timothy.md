# Discourse on Michael the Archangel by Timothy, Archangel of Alexandria

Michael is said to have suffered at the doors of hell, bound Satan and released the captive spirits under the direction of Christ. Upon Jesus’ resurrection, the Father granted Him power, and in turn Jesus “arrayed Michael in great and indescribable splendour.” They seem to have been exalted together, in their different spheres (p. Fol. 70b).
