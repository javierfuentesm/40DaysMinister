#The Acts of Saint James in India

Christ appears to Peter and James and teaches them of the recompense they will receive for their sufferings on earth (A, fol. 111b, col. 1; B, fol. 224a, col. 2). He also shows them many righteous men from the beginning of the world to the advent of Christ. He also pronounces a blessing upon James (A, fol. 111b, col. 2; B, fol. 224b, col. 1).
