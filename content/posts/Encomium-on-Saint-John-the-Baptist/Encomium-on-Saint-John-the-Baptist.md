# Encomium on Saint John the Baptist, by John Chrysostom


Jesus gives his great commission, but also speaks concerning the present glory of John the Baptist (Fol. 10a, Fol. 10b). He ascends with the Apostles through the heavens and they see John the Baptist and Zacharias in the third heaven, where men are arrayed in “celestial apparel” (Fol. 10b – Fol. 12b). Details pertaining to Heaven and Paradise are given and the Apostles are brought back onto the Mount of Olives.
