# The Preaching of Saint Thomas in India
Christ appears and instructs the apostles to divide the world into twelve portions, and to go forth and preach. As words of comfort, He assures the apostles that the persecutions which they shall endure are known to Him, and he exhorts them to bear suffering patiently (A, fol.119b, col. I). On another occasion he appears to Thomas, only to assure him that all of his scourging are not to be “compared with one hour of the rest” which he is to receive in the kingdom of God (B, fol. 238a, col. I).
