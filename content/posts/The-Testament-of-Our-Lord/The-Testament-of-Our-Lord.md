# The Testament of Our Lord
Jesus speaks to His apostles and tells them a little concerning the glory of those who will believe on their words (1:1) and warns of future persecutors (1:4-5) and dissenters (1:8). Rewards for those who suffer persecutions are alluded to (1:8), Regulations relating to the dispensing of the secret knowledge is given (1:18), and anointing rites are described (2:8-9).
