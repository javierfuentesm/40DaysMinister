# The Preaching of Saint Matthias in the City of the Cannibals
The resurrected Lord appears to Andrew and sends him to go and release Matthias from the prisonhouse (B, fol. 211a, col. 2). Later in the text the Lord informs Andrew that “in this city” much suffering will come upon him (A, fol. 104a, col. 1).
